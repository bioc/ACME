Description: ACME (Algorithms for Calculating Microarray Enrichment) is
        a set of tools for analysing tiling array ChIP/chip, DNAse
        hypersensitivity, or other experiments that result in regions
        of the genome showing "enrichment".  It does not rely on a
        specific array technology (although the array should be a
        "tiling" array), is very general (can be applied in experiments
        resulting in regions of enrichment), and is very insensitive to
        array noise or normalization methods.  It is also very fast and
        can be applied on whole-genome tiling array experiments quite
        easily with enough memory.
